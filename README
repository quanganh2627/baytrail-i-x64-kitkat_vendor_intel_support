To load and boot your images, we use fastboot.
Although you can script the fastboot yourself, you should
instead use the flash_device.sh script in this directory.
flash_device.sh may also be found in the tool/ directory in the
release tree.
  Usage: flash_device.sh

Procedure to boot using fastboot:
  * Update your firmware to the latest version (see the release tree)
  * Update your target device with the latest kboot (see the release tree)
  * Be sure to use the latest fastboot (tool directory in the release tree)
  * Be sure to use the latest adb (tool directory in the release tree)
  * Connect your platform to your Linux Host system via USB.
  * Reboot the platform.
