To build the Moorestown "mrst_edv" image from the top of the source tree:
  source build/envsetup.sh
  lunch mrst_edv-eng
  make mrst_edv

host system build setup assumes:
  o AOSP build system packages are present:
  o http://source.android.com/source/download.html

Ubuntu Linux (32-bit x86)  [also works 
  sudo apt-get install git-core gnupg flex bison gperf libsdl-dev \
                 libesd0-dev libwxgtk2.6-dev build-essential zip curl \
                 libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev 

Ubuntu Linux (64-bit x86)
  sudo apt-get install git-core gnupg flex bison gperf build-essential zip curl \
               zlib1g-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 lib32ncurses5-dev \

Froyo still requiers jdk 1.5. You need to get that from java from:

NOTE: the new master branch is moving the jdk 1.6 and a TBD 64 bit build host requierment.

To load and boot your images, we use fastboot.
Although you can script the fastboot yourself, you should
instead use the flash_device.sh script in this directory.
flash_device.sh may also be found in the tool/ directory in the
release tree.
  Usage: flash_device.sh [-d nand|sd] (default sd)

Procedure to boot using fastboot and creating SD card images:
  * Update your firmware to the latest version (see the release tree)
  * Update your target device with the latest kboot (see the release tree)
  * Be sure to use the latest fastboot (tool directory in the release tree)
  * Be sure to use the latest adb (tool directory in the release tree)
  * Connect your platform to your Linux Host system via USB.
  * Reboot the platform , you will see the following boot messages on serial console

    *************************************************************************
       Android Kboot. version: kboot built by root for ivydale on ...
    *************************************************************************
    
    Override aboot version by putting it on the root of the media partition (mmcblk0p3)
    
    To terminate aboot: Hit ESC on your internal keyboard.
    To disable autoboot either:
     - Execute a fastboot command (other than getvar).
     - Place the file 'no_autoboot' on your boot partition.
     - Stroke the touch screen
     - Press any key or button
    Listening for the fastboot protocol on the USB OTG.
    KBoot> Autobooting in 8 seconds...
 
  When you see this message, within 8 seconds either hit a key (except
  <Esc>) in the keypad OR enter any fastboot command from your Linux
  system console to disable Autoboot. Example fastboot command:
    fastboot oem system echo

Now Autoboot should be stopped and you are ready to load binary images into
the SD card inserted into the target platform. Use flash_device.sh:
  TARGET={ivydale|mrst_ref|mrst_edv}
  cd out/target/product/$TARGET
  flash_device.sh
