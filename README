To build the Moorestown "mrst_edv" image from the top of the srouce tree:
  ./vendor/intel/support/kernel-build-hack.sh -c mrst_edv
  source build/envsetup.sh
  lunch mrst_edv-eng
  make mrst_edv

host system build setup assumes:
AOSP build system packages are pressent:

sudo apt-get install git-core gnupg flex bison gperf libsdl-dev libesd0-dev libwxgtk2.6-dev build-essential zip curl libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev

Froyo still requiers jdk 1.5  You need to get that from java from:

NOTE: the new master branch is moving the jdk 1.6 and a TBD 64 bit build host requierment. 




To load and boot your images, we use fastboot.
i.e.:

Procedure to boot using fastboot and creating SD card images:
* Update your target  platform with the latest  “kboot_fastboot”  (named like
USB-kboot.ivydale.2010.0701.1432.bin)  the same way you updated   kboot using
‘FSTK” tool.  Make sure you have the lastest “fastboot” binary present in your
Linux Host system.

* Connect your platform to your Linux Host system via USB.

* Reboot the platform , you will see the following boot messages  on serial   console

*************************************************************************
   Android Kboot. version: kboot built by root for ivydale on ...
*************************************************************************

Override aboot version by putting it on the root of the media partition (mmcblk0p3)

To terminate aboot: Hit ESC on your internal keyboard.
To disable autoboot either:
 - Execute a fastboot command (other than getvar).
 - Place the file 'no_autoboot' on your boot partition.
 - Stroke the touch screen
 - Press any key or button
Listening for the fastboot protocol on the USB OTG.
KBoot> Autobooting in 8 seconds...
 
When you see this message, within 8 seconds either hit a key (except <Esc>) in
the keypad OR   enter any fastboot command from your Linux system console to
disable Autoboot.  Example fastboot command:  fastboot oem system echo 

Now Autoboot  should be  stopped and you are ready to load binary images into
the SD card inserted into the  target platform.  Enter the following commands
from your Linux Host  system console.:
(you should be in ../out/target/product/$TARGET directory) 

fastboot oem system /sbin/PartitionDisk.sh /dev/mmcblk0 

fastboot erase boot 
fastboot erase system 
fastboot erase userdata 
fastboot erase recovery 
fastboot erase media 
fastboot erase cache 
fastboot flash boot boot_sdcard.tar.gz     
fastboot flash system system.tar.gz

fastboot continue  (This command will restart the boot process using the newly
added img files)
