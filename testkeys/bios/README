The PK, KEK and DB key pairs are required by UEFI BIOS for security
boot. The 1st UEFI boot loader should be signed with DB key pairs. and
certificates of PK, KEK and DB should be enrolled into BIOS with the
help either from UEFI applications in installer or operations in BIOS
setup menu by the user.

These key pairs are generated for test purposes (security boot,
OTA...) only with these commands.

 openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -subj "/CN=PK/" -keyout PK.key \
     -out PK.crt -days 36500 -nodes -sha256
 openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -subj "/CN=KEK/" -keyout KEK.key \
     -out KEK.crt -days 36500 -nodes -sha256
 openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -subj "/CN=DB/" -keyout DB.key \
     -out DB.crt -days 36500 -nodes -sha256

Certificates (*.DER) in binary format are generated with:

openssl x509 -in DB.crt -outform der -out DB.DER
openssl x509 -in KEK.crt -outform der -out KEK.DER
openssl x509 -in PK.crt -outform der -out PK.DER

Developers and OEMs should provide their own key pairs if they want to
use their own private keys to sign 1st UEFI boot loader and enroll the
certificates into BIOS. They shall have their own approach to manage
their keys as well.

If we provide any signed binary to customers (official released binaries),
these test keys shall NOT be used.
