Provide static keys to sign kernel modules for several reasons:

(1) make dual-boot users happier because Windows takes BIOS time as local time
which is GMT in Linux. The automatically generated certificates from kbuild will
not be valid earlier than the build time (GMT). Kernel can not load signed modules
if Windows set the local time (even the time looks correct to user) in BIOS when
that time is earlier then the build time of certificate.

Note: static keys cannot stop Windows set an unsuitable time into BIOS anyway.
This solution with static keys will fail if Windows set a time too early. A fix
or a workaround at Windows side is the way to go.

(2) Reduce the image delta size in OTA package

The two keys will be copied into kbuild output directory when compiling kernel.

THE KEY ARE GENERATED WITH INVALID IDENTITIES AND ONLY FOR TEST PURPOSES.
REPLACE THEM WITH YOUR OWN PROTECTED KEYS IN FORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND RELEASES.

(The intended workflow is to replace with the real keys using Android's
sign_target_files_apks, and not to replace the keys in the build system.)
