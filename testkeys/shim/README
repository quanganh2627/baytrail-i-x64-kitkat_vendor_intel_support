The shim key pair is used by the uefi_shim security services to
verify the second-stage loader (Gummiboot). It will also be used
to sign and verify the AOSP boot images. The keys provided here
are for testing only and were generated with this command:

openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -subj "/CN=Android-IA UEFI shim test-key, NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE./" \
    -keyout shim.key -out shim.crt -days 36500 -nodes -sha256

If we provide any signed binary to customers (official released binaries),
these test keys shall NOT be used.
